    1.1 Release History

    CSM 3.0.1

    --  22 July 2005
    
    CSM 3.0

    --  31 March 2005    

    
----------------------------------------------------------------
    1.2 New Features and Updates
----------------------------------------------------------------

    CSM provides a flexible, comprehensive solution to common
    security objectives.  Development teams can use CSM services
    rather than creating their own independent security methodology. 

    +------------------------------------+
    | CSM APIs                           |
    +------------------------------------+
    
    This CSM release provides the following services:
    
    --  Standard Privileges - In order to become compliant with JAAS
        and Authorization Policy CSM has adapted a standard set of 
	privileges. These privileges can be used across systems.  
	They will automatically populate into an authorization schema
	with the SQL priming scripts provided in this release.  If a
	schema has already been created, we have provided a migration
	script that will add the privileges.
	
	Privileges include:
	
	CREATE - This privilege grants permission to a user to create
	an entity.  This entity can be an object, a database entry, 
	or a resource such as a network connection.
	
	ACCESS - This privilege allows a user to access a particular 
	resource.  Examples of resources include a network 
	connection, database connection, socket, module of the 
	application, or even the application itself.

	READ - This privilege permits the user to read data from a 
	file, URL, socket, database, or an object. This can be used 
	at an entity level signifying that the user is allowed to 
	read data about a particular entry (which can be object or 
	database row, etc.)

	WRITE - This privilege allows a user to write data to a file,
	URL, socket, database, or object. This can also be used at an
	entity level signifying that the user is allowed to write 
	data about a particular entity (which may include an object, 
	database row, etc.)

	UPDATE - This privilege grants permission at an entity level 
	and signifies that the user is allowed to update and modify 
	data for a particular entity.  Entities may include an 
	object, an attribute of the object, a database row, etc.

	DELETE - This privilege permits a user to delete a logical 
	entity. This entity can be an object, a database entry, a 
	resource such as a network connection, etc.

	EXECUTE - This privilege allows a user to execute a 
	particular resource. The resource can be a method, function,
	behavior of the application, URL, button etc.     
        
		
    --  Primitive Types - The secureObjects method of the API needs 
        was modified to throw an error for data objects that contain
	attributes of primitive data types. This method supports only
	objects coded to the Java Bean specifications.

    --  Reporting Functionality - The API was updated to provide new 
        methods to support the reporting. This method will return the
	object privilege map for the given user id. The object 
	privilege map contains the protection elements with the 
	corresponding privileges for a given user. 
	
    --  Cross-Browser Compatability - CSM was modified to work with 
        both MySQL and Oracle.  The Authorization Schema database is
	now independent to support various databases. 
        
        
    +------------------------------------+
    | User Provisioning Tool (UPT)       |
    +------------------------------------+

    --  Standard Privileges - The UPT was modified to accomodate the
        Standard Privileges mentioned above.  We removed the create,
	update and delete operations from the Privilege section of 
	the Admin Mode. These operations were incorporated into a 
	new Privilege section in the Super Admin Mode.  Therefore 
	only a Super Admin can modify CSM Standard Privileges.  Admin
	administrators will still have the ability to view the
	privileges and assign them to roles, and subsequently to
	users.
        
    --  Association Screens - We increased the width of the combo
        boxes on the associations screens to allow for names with a 
	large length to display properly.  All associated screens 
	received this update.

    --  Reporting Functionality - The UPT offers a new report in the
        User section.  This report will display the list of all 
	protection elements and the associated privileges for the 
	selected user. This report is provided in a manner that
	will be useful to the developers which are integrating the
	security in their applications.  It provides the parameters
	needed for the checkPermission method of the API, namely the
	user name, the protection element object id, attribute and 
	privilege.

    1.3 Bugs Fixed Since Last Release
----------------------------------------------------------------
        
    +------------------------------------+
    | User Provisioning Tool (UPT)       |
    +------------------------------------+

    --  Mozilla Compatability - The latest NCICB UI standards
        require web appications to support both IE and Mozilla 
	browsers.  The UPT tool has been enhanced to function
	properly with Mozilla's Firefox browser.

    --  UI Fixes - The following errors were addressed:
    
	In the prior release, when clicking on the project logo in 
	the header of the Super Admin mode, it redirected the user 
	to the Admin home page.  Now the link correctly directs the
	user to the Super Admin mode. 

	In the Admin functionality, the main menu was displayed in 
	two rows. The menu now displays in one row only.
