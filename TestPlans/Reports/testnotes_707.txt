Test notes


1) More exception improvements.  Here's the exception thrown to the client:

CSM schema not configured:
Either you are not in session or you don't have privilege to READ this object

Server down:
Cannot access HTTP invoker remote service at [http://localhost:8080/sdkremoting/http/remoteService]; nested exception is java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused: connect


2) When turning security level to 0 in properties-service file, still reading as 0 and 
accessing schema to make security decisions.  
(FIXED TODAY)

3) When security level set to 0, get NullPointerException when trying to kill session because no 
session was created.  
(FIXED TODAY)
