    CSM 3.0

    --  31 March 2005    

    
----------------------------------------------------------------
    1.2 Features
----------------------------------------------------------------

    CSM provides a flexible, comprehensive solution to common
    security objectives.  Development teams can use CSM services
    rather than creating their own independent security methodology. 


    +------------------------------------+
    | CSM APIs                           |
    +------------------------------------+

    Features
    ----------------
    This CSM release provides the following services:
    
    --  Authentication - validating and verifying a user’s 
        credentials to allow access to an application. CSM currently
        supports two credential providers:        
        -- Lightweight Directory Access Protocol(LDAP)
        -- Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS)
        
        The Authentication Service provides the following features:
        
        -- It allows the application developers to configure single
        or multiple credential providers for various applications.
        
        -- It authenticates user credentials against the configured
        providers.
        
    --  Authorization - granting access to data, methods, and
        objects. CSM incorporates an Authorization schema which
        holds the authorization data for a particular application.
        At run-time, CSM uses this data to make a security decision.
        
        The Authorization Service provides the following features:
        
        -- Object level security check.
        
        -- Attribute level security check.
        
        -- Creation of Protection Elements at run-time.
        
        -- Association of Protection Elements to Protection Groups
           at run-time.
           
        -- Obtaining references to entities such as Protection Elements,
           Protection Groups, Users, etc..
           
        -- Obtaining the collection of Privileges for a user for a 
           Protection Element.
           
        -- Obtaining principals for a user.
        
        

    +------------------------------------+
    | User Provisioning Tool (UPT)       |
    +------------------------------------+

    Features
    ----------------
    --  CSM provides a web-based UPT that can easily be integrated
        with a single or multiple applications and authorization
        databases. The UPT provides functionality to create
        authorization data elements like Roles, Privileges,
        Protection Elements, Users, etc., and also provides
        functionality to associate them with each other. The runtime
        API can then use this authorization data to authorize user
        actions. 
        
        The User Provisioning Tool provides the following features:
        
        -- Register an application and assign application 
           administrators (Super Admin mode).
        
        -- Create, Read, Update, and Delete authorization data
           elements.
        
        -- Search using relevant criteria.
        
        -- Group elements together.  Assign users to groups, privileges
           to roles, and protection elements to protection groups.
        
        -- Form associations between elements. For example, Assign a 
           Protection Group and Roles to a User.
